1. You can have many side branches, but you can only have 1 master branch

# CREATE NEW BRANCH 
git branch branch-name

# Show all branches
git branch -a

# SWITCHING BRANCHES 
git checkout other-branch-name
git switch other-branch-name

#Status
git status

# Renaming branches 
- git branch -m new-name

- rename unactive branch 
- git branch -m feature-one renamed-feature-one

# PUBLISHING A NEW BRANCH 
git push -u origin renamed-feature-one
-u gives us the tracking feature

# Creating a local branch and tracking the remote branch 
git branch --track feature/login origin/feature/login

# Pulling and pushing branches 
git pull
git push 

# Check updates of which branch is ahead of behind
git branch -v

# Deleting branch 
Not all branches are meant to be for forever, feel free to delete them from time to time, you cannot delete the current active branch 

Deleting from local codebase, do this if you wanna delete all updates made
git branch -d renamed-feature-one

If you're removing from the branch from your repo you should also delete it from local, to avoid a messy code base. 

git push origin --delete renamed-feature-one
